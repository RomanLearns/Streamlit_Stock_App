# Streamlit_Stock_Predictor
This is a project I am doing for class in which I am required to make predictions on the future prices of indices, namely the SP500 and IBEX35, using RNN, LSTM, and GRU models. This work reflects what went into my assignment as well as the application I ended up making to help make these predictions

To run this, you need to first run feature_computation.py, then train_models.py, and then stock_app.py. Enchanced_stock_prediction.ipynb and price_prediction_models.ipynb are just there for EDA

Thank you!
