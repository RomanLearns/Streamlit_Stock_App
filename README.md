# Streamlit_Stock_Predictor
This is a project I am doing for class in which I am required to make predictions on the future prices of indices, namely the SP500 and IBEX35, using RNN, LSTM, and GRU models. This work reflects what went into my assignment as well as the application I ended up making to help make these predictions
